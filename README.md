This is my first ever web development project (from The Odin Project). <br> 
I started this journey 3 weeks ago and learned a ton! In recreating <br>
the google search page, I understood more about positioning with flexbox. <br>
I'm sure many of my codes are not up to the standards of best practices. <br>
Therefore, I am happy to feedbacks as it will help me improve!
